Online platforms often struggle with toxic and harmful comments, which can negatively impact user experience. This project aims to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## Features
- Identifies toxic comments in online discussions.
- Uses NLP to analyze text for offensive or harmful language.
- Can be integrated into websites or forums for automatic moderation.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Comment-classifier
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
